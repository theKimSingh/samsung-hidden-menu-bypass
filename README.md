# samsung-hidden-menu-bypass
 This is the tool used by many for bypassing the carrier-locked hidden menu. Common carriers include Verizon and U.S. Mobile. Found from a reddit comment posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/c9tovo/samsung_network_engineering_menu/ (the dropbox link doesn't work anymore).
